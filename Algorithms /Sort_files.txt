Input: List pointer pointing to the first node of Linked list of folders
       Each Node of Link list points to the linked list of files
       Map storing the extensions and names for folder
Output: Files are sorted in Main Folder

STEP:1 While Traversing each node through the Linked list do:
    (1) Check whether the directory exists or not
      if directory exists do for each directory
      Iterate through each file of the directory
    (2) For each file, check for the file extension
     Search for the file extension in the map
     If extension is found in the map do
     define path for new subdirectory and create the directory
End while

STEP:2
(1) Iterate through each file again.
(2) For each file, extract the file extension.
    Look up the extension in the extension_to_name map.
(3) If the extension is found in the map:
Move the file to the corresponding subdirectory.

STEP:3 Traverse to the next node of Linked list and repeat

Let the total number of the files existed in all the folders given in input is 'n'
Let the size of the unoredered map is 'x'
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(x)
