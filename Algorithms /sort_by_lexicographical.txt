Required header file - algorithm, vector

	Algorithm for sortfilebylexicological function

	Input: 2D-Linked list base address
	Output: sorted file in all folders by lexicological

	Steps: While traveling all nodes of the linked list do
 
	(1) check whether folderpath exists using fs::exists or fs::is_directory, filesystem function.
	(2) Create a vector of string name file paths that store file paths of the folder.
	(3) Sort vector lexicological. The files will be sorted by their names in increasing order.
	(4) create one temporary folder. 
	(5) move all files from vector to a temporary folder and rename the file path.
	(6) Move all files from a temporary folder to an origin folder and rename the file path to the origin path.
	(7)Delete the temporary folder.

	End While.


	Let the total number of the files from the all folders is 'n'
	Time complexity : O(n)
	Space complexity : O(1)
