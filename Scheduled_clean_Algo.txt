Algorithm of cleanFilesAfterInterval Function
Using Filesystem and chrono as addidtional required headerfiles
Input(Argument): A vector of filepath of the files to be deleted
                interval 't' in minutes after which file has to be deleted
Output: Delete the files after 't' minutes

Steps:
(1) Store current time of the system using system_clock::now() Function
(2) While(true) do
    (1)calculate elapsed time which equals the diffrence between system's current time and already stored time
    (2)convert elapsed time duration into minutes
    (3)if(elapsed_minutes >=t)do
    Iterate through the vector of filepaths using for loop,
    if(file exists or its a regular file) do
    delete file using  filesystem::remove function
    end if
    (4)end for loop
    exit() after deleting the files
    end if
    using sleep_for function to freeze for a short duration to avoid load on CPU
    end while
